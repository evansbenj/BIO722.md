# Genotyping with bcftools

A common way that genotype information is conveyed is the `variant call format` – vcf, which is is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format). Another new format introduced by the [`Genome Analysis Toolkit`](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) of the Broad Institute is called the genomic variant call format – gvcf; this is described [here](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/4017/what-is-a-gvcf-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-regular-vcf).

Now lets make a vcf file from our bam files. We have everything we need to make a genotype (vcf) file with all of the samples, including:
* sorted bam files for each sample
* an index for each bam file (.bai file)
* a genome (actually a chromosome in our case for one chromosome - chrZZZ.fa) and also supporting files (chrZZZ.amb  chrZZZ.fa.ann  chrZZZ.fa.bwt  chrZZZ.fa.fai  chrZZZ.fa.pac  chrZZZ.fa.sa).

Please start a screen and type this command:

```
bcftools mpileup -Ou -f ../my_monkey_chromosome/chrZZZ.fa PF515_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM561_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM565_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM566_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM567_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM582_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM584_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM592_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam PM602_chrZZZ_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam | bcftools call -mv -Oz -o allsamples_chrZZZ_merged_sorted_realigned_dedup.bam.vcf.gz

```

The command above first uses the bcftools mpileup command. You can check out what the options are by typing `bcftools` and `bcftools mpileup`. You will see that the `mpileup` command generates genotype likelihoods from multiple `.bam` files. This is then piped to the `bcftools call` command, which does SNP and indel genotype calling.  The `-Ou` and `-Oz` command asks `bcftools` generate uncompressed BCF output and a compressed vcf output respectively.

This should finish quickly because we are working with small subsets of the data. Please exit the screen by typing `ctrl-a` and `ctrl-d`

Because we are working with such a small (subsetted) dataset, your bam files have only very few reads that mapped to your chromosome and they are at very low depth. At this point, let's work with files I made earlier using the complete dataset.  Please make a symbolic link to thes files like this:

```
ln -s /2/scratch/Bio722_BJE/chr1_only.recode.vcf.gz
ln -s /2/scratch/Bio722_BJE/chr2_only.recode.vcf.gz
ln -s /2/scratch/Bio722_BJE/chrX_only.recode.vcf.gz
```

And now check out this file like this:

```
zmore chr1_only.recode.vcf.gz

```

Here you need to use `zmore` instead of `more` because the file are compressed (gzipped).

You can also check the header and the first few lines like this:
```
zcat chr1_only.recode.vcf.gz | grep '#CHR' -A 3 
```
This will give you the main comment line (which always begins with #CHR in vcf files) plus 3 lines of data that follow (-A 3).

# Vcf format

The format of the vcf file is explained [here](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf).  This is a widely used genotyping format that can be uses as input for many softwares (e.g. the R package [PopGenome](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PopGenome/PopGenome.pdf)) or exported to other formats (e.g. using [PLINK](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/)).

OK, now let's calculate some summary statistics from these files.  Please click [here](https://github.com/evansbenj/BIO722.md/blob/main/6_summary_statistics.md)
