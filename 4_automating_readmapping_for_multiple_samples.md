# Automating readmapping for multiple samples with a bash script

Now that you have seen how to align data from one individual to a reference genome, we can automate the alignment of all individuals to the reference genome using a bash script. This is easier than going through all that stuff independently for each individual. We can accomplish this by defining a vector that contains the names of all of the individuals in the analysis, and then looping through this vector and executing each of the commands for each individual.

Below is an example `bash` script that should run all of our analyses for each individual.  Please use a text editor to make this program on info.  In the beginning of the script, four variables are defined that specify, respectively, the path for the data and reference genome (here an individual chromosome), and the name of the chromosome you are working on (which will be passed in as a variable). You will need to modify the variables to have your USERNAME in the paths. For example, change the `USERNAME` in the `path_to_data="/2/scratch/USERNAME/monkey_directory/demultiplexed_subsetted_fq"` to whatever your username is  (e.g. `gradstd13`) and the same for the `path_to_chromosome` variable.

I have set the `$chromosome` variable to take a argument `${1}` that we will pass to the script when it is executed.  It is a good idea to do this for computecanada SLURM scripts too. You can pass in as many arguments as you want, separated by a space. They are then used with sequential numbering (`${1}`,`${2}`,`${3}`, etc).

```
#!/bin/bash                                                                                            

path_to_data="/2/scratch/USERNAME/monkey_directory/demultiplexed_subsetted_fq/"
path_to_chromosome="/2/scratch/USERNAME/monkey_directory/my_monkey_chromosome/"
chromosome=${1}

PM561

PM567

PM602"

for each_individual in $individuals
do
    # echo which individual we are on
    echo ${each_individual}

    # align the data to the reference gemome
    bwa mem -t 16 -R "@RG\tID:FLOWCELL1.LANE6\tSM:${each_individual}\tPL:illumina" ../my_monkey_chromosome/${
chromosome}.fa ../demultiplexed_subsetted_fq/${each_individual}.fastq.gz | samtools view -bSh - > ${each_indi
vidual}_${chromosome}.bam

    # sort the bam file
    samtools sort ${each_individual}_$chromosome.bam -o ${each_individual}_${chromosome}_sorted.bam
    
    # index the sorted bam file
    samtools index ${each_individual}_${chromosome}_sorted.bam
    
    # clean up unsorted file
    rm ${each_individual}_${chromosome}.bam
done

```



Now we need to make the file executable, so type this:

`chmod +x alignment_commando`

And now we should be able to execute the file.  Type this:

`./alignment_commando chrZZZ`

Here we needed to preceed the name of our `bash` script by `./` to tell the computer where to find our script (i.e. in the current working directory). Also, instead of `chrZZZ` you should add whatever your chromosome is (e.g. `chr2` or `chr9`).

Now please check whether this worked by checking out the file size of the `.bam` files in your directory like this:

`ls -l`

You should see lots of file including, for each sample a `_sorted.bam` file that is not of file size zero.  Each file should have an index (`.bai`) as well.




##  Practice Problem 3 (for home): 

Please try out combining some of the tricks that Brian told you about last class to modify the bash script to run the commands without listing the file names in the script.


## OK now we are ready to combine our bam files and do some genotyping. Please click [here](https://github.com/evansbenj/XXX)
